# JFSS Computer Science Club
---
This repository contains all the resources used in the John Fraser Computer Science club for the academic year of 2019/2020. 

We will be exploring Software Development in depth, including building Cloud Actions with Google Assistant, creating APIs using Node + Express, and potentially some frontend frameworks such as React, or just pure HTML/CSS/EJS

It is best to use a desktop editor with the various runtimes installed on your computer, but if you need to code on your browser, please make an account for [codesandbox.io](Codesandbox).

This page will be updated as time goes on.


## Lesson Scheduling
---
All lessons will be led by club members. Please message me on Slack or Discord if you would like to teach a particular lesson, or if you have suggestions for what to learn.
